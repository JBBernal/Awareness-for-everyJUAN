<p><big>Gender awareness raising aims to promote and encourage a general understanding of gender-related challenges, for instance, violence against women and the gender pay gap. It also aims to show how values and norms influence our reality, reinforce stereotypes and support the structures that produce inequalities.<br>

<br>It plays an important role in informing women and men about gender equality, the benefits of a more gender-equal society and the consequences of gender inequality. For example, raising awareness about the proven economic benefits of advancing gender equality, such as the strong, positive impact on gross domestic product (GDP) and higher levels of employment, and about the profound negative impact of gender inequalities, for instance, the fact that women are at a higher risk of poverty because of lower employment prospects.<br>

<br>Gender awareness is an important role in our life, this the knowledge and understanding of the differences in roles and relations between women and men. Its important to continualy raise gender awareness among government officials and the public general. Gender Awareness is increasing general sensitivity, understanding and knowledge. Gender Awareness raising crucial for integrating a gender perspective into policies, programmes, projects and services that responnds to the different needs of women and men, raising of this awareness means providing reliable and accessible information to create or build a better understanding of gender equality.</br>

<br><br>These people must include on our top list on promoting equality:

<p><center><i>Gender Equality</i> (2021) by Orlan Lumawag Jr. <br>Gender equality is hard to attain due to the past discrimination, stereotypes and sometimes culture and traditions but we will attain it if everyone do their part and treat people not based on their sexuality and their gender but to treat people because they deserve the way they're treated. (Lumawag, O. Jr., 2021)</center></p>
<ul><big><b>Why should we include these people?</b></big></ul>
<li><big>Violence against women is preventable and policy-makers can play a critical role in this regard. We know more than ever before about what works to prevent violence against women.
<br>
About 1 in 3 or 35% of women worldwide have experienced either physical and/or sexual violence by an intimate partner or non-partner sexual violence in their lifetime, according to global estimates by the World Health Organization (WHO).
<br>	
Violence against women (VAW) has devastating costs and consequences on individuals, communities and societies. It is a major public health problem and a violation of women’s human rights. It is rooted in gender inequality and an impediment to sustainable development.</big></li>

<p><center><i>Media</i> (2021) by Frances Abaigar <br>"Media" is a storyboard animatic made by yours truly, where (unnamed) Bunso asks his (unnamed) Ate why there's a lot of (proper) women and LGBTQ+ representation in media nowadays. You can watch the animation by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tf39U6JXyNE" target="_blank" rel="noopener nereferrer"> clicking this.</a> "Media plays an important role in our lives growing up and could help build impressions, as well as stereotypes, regardless of race and gender. In the early years of television, most women are presented or viewed from a man's perspective, and there are almost no LGBTQ+ representation which could build up harmful stereotypes and views on women and gay people. It's a good thing that there are a lot of proper women and LGBTQ+ representation in our media nowadays to break those stereotypes." (Abaigar, 2021)</center></p>
<p><b><big>What is the Meaning of LGBTQ?</big></b></p>
<p><big>LGBTQ is an acronym for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer or questioning. These terms are used to describe a person’s sexual orientation or gender identity. But as of now, its complete name is LGBTQQIP2SAA which is lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, questioning, queer, intersex, pansexual, two-spirit (2S), androgynous and asexual.</big></p>
<p><b><big>Why should we include these people?</big></b></p>
<ul>
	<li><b><big>They are still persons and we must respect on what they choose.</b>- People have their own choice on what gender they like. It is called as Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity and Expression; also known as "SOGIE". Sexual Orientation means it describes to whom a person is sexually attracted. Some people are attracted to people of a particular gender; others are attracted to people of more than one gender. Some are not attracted to anyone. These includes:
	<ol>
		<li>Asexual - not sexually attracted to anyone and/or no desire to act on attraction to anyone. Does not
necessarily mean sexless. Asexual people sometimes do experience affectional (romantic) attraction. </li>
<li>Bisexual - attracted to people of one’s own gender and people of other gender(s). Two common
misconceptions are that bisexual people are attracted to everyone and anyone, or that they just haven’t
“decided.” Often referred to as “bi.”</li>
<li>Gay - generally refers to a man who is attracted to men. Sometimes refers to all people who are attracted
to people of the same sex; sometimes “homosexual” is used for this also, although this term is seen by many
today as a medicalized term that should be retired from common use. </li>
<li>Lesbian - a woman who is attracted to women. Sometimes also or alternately “same-gender-loving
woman” or “woman loving woman.”</li>
<li>Pansexual/Fluid - attracted to people regardless of gender. Sometimes also or alternately “omnisexual” or
“polysexual.” See also Bisexual and Queer. </li>
<li>Questioning - one who may be unsure of, reconsidering, or chooses to hold off identifying their sexual
identity or gender expression or identity</li>
<li>Queer - traditionally a derogatory term, yet reclaimed and appropriated by some LGBTQ individuals as a
term of self-identification. It is an umbrella term which embraces a matrix of sexual preferences, gender
expressions, and habits that are not of the heterosexual, heteronormative, or gender-binary majority. It is not
a universally accepted term by all members of the LGBT community, and it is often considered offensive
when used by heterosexuals.
</li>
<li>Straight - attracted to people of the “opposite” sex (see below); also sometimes generally used to refer to
people whose sexualities are societally normative. Alternately referred to as “heterosexual.” </li>
<li>Two-spirit - refers to a person who identifies as having both a masculine and a feminine spirit, and is used by some Indigenous people to describe their sexual, gender and/or spiritual identity.</li>
<li>Androgyny - condition in which characteristics of both sexes are clearly expressed in a single individual. In biology, androgyny refers to individuals with fully developed sexual organs of both sexes, also called hermaphrodites.</li>
<li>Intersex - have a diversity of bodies and gender identities, and may identify as male or female or neither.</li>
<br>Gender Identity and Expression are the ways in which a person identifies and/or expresses their gender, including self-image, appearance, and embodiment of gender roles. One’s sex (e.g. male, female, intersex, etc.) is usually assigned at birth based on
one’s physical biology. One’s gender (e.g. male, female, genderqueer, etc.) is one’s internal sense of self and
identity. One’s gender expression (e.g. masculine, feminine, androgynous, etc.) is how one embodies gender
attributes, presentations, roles, and more. Example of those are:
<ol>
	<li>Androgyny - The mixing of masculine and feminine gender expression or the lack of gender identification.
The terms androgyne, agender, and neutrois are sometimes used by people who identify as genderless,
non-gendered, beyond or between genders, or some combination thereof. </li>
<li>Cisgender - A gender identity that society considers to “match” the biological sex assigned at birth. The
prefix cis- means “on this side of” or “not across from.” A term used to call attention to the privilege of
people who are not transgender.
</li>
<li>Crossdresser - Cross-dressing refers to occasionally wearing clothing of the “opposite” gender, and
someone who considers this an integral part of their identity may identify as a crossdresser (note: the term
crossdresser is preferable to transvestite and neither may ever be used to describe a transsexual person).
Cross-dressing is not necessarily tied to erotic activity or sexual orientation.</li>
<li>Genderqueer/Third Gender/Gender Fluid - These terms are used by people who identify as being between
and/or other than male or female. They may feel they are neither, a little bit of both, or they may simply feel
restricted by gender labels. </li>
<li>Intersex - A general term used for a variety of genetic, hormonal, or anatomical conditions in which a
person is born with a reproductive or sexual anatomy that doesn’t seem to fit the typical definitions of
female or male. Some intersex individuals identify as transgender or gender variant; others do not. (Note:
hermaphrodite is an obsolete term that is not currently considered appropriate.) </li>
<li>Transgender - First coined to distinguish gender benders with no desire for surgery or hormones from
transsexuals, those who desired to legally and medically change their sex, more recently transgender
and/or trans has become an umbrella term popularly used to refer to all people who transgress dominant
conceptions of gender, or at least all who identify themselves as doing so. The definition continues to
evolve. </li>
<li>Transsexual - The term transsexual has historically been used to refer to individuals who have medically and
legally changed their sex, or who wish to do so. Most transsexual people feel a conflict between their
gender identity and the sex they were assigned at birth. Other labels used within this group are <i>MtF</i> (male-to-female) or trans woman, and <i>FtM</i> (female-to-male) or <i>trans man.</i> </li>
<li>Two-Spirit – A person who identified with the Native American tradition of characterizing certain members
of the community as having the spirit of both the male and female genders.
